<h1>Its never too late... Workout success</h1>

<ol>
<li>Make a plan the night before: yoga class, a run, spin class, weight workout with a friend.</li>
<li>Workout in the am, not because it may burn more fat but because it WILL get done and life will not get in the way. When you take care of yourself and get your endorphins going first thing,  your day seems to go a lot smoother.</li>
<li>Adding a few HIIT ( high intensity interval training) workouts in your week.  In 20 minutes or less,  you get your heart pumping and you fire up your metabolism,  all thanks to the “afterburn”. </li>
<li>Finding a workout that fits in your lifestyle. Fitness is not temporary,  it can be forever, you may not being running marathons, but anything that strengthens your bones and pumps your heart is the point. </li>
<li>WATER!! THE most important nutrient. It is super important to be and keep hydrated throughout your workout and during recovery.  Aim for at least 12 oz before, during and after your workout.  Being hydrated will prevent muscle cramping, increase your strength and energy and it will  also prevent heat exhaustion and light headedness.</li>
<li>Record your workouts in a journal.  Your journal can be valuable history. Noting what you did, how you felt and how far you r have come, can be very encouraging.</li>
<li>A “CAN DO” attitude. With consistency, self discipline, patience and a positive mindset you will not just meet your fitness goals but have fun doing them and feel amazing.</li>
