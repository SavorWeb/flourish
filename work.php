	<h1>FLOURISH: Fat Loss Finality </h1>
		<p>This 8-week program is specifically designed for your own personal metabolism. No more cookie cutter programs. No one-size-fits-all. Nothing is left to chance. We are here to burn fat, and burn fat we will! This is the LAST time I want you to buckle down and burn fat – we are on a mission here, and I will take you to the finish line.</p>

		<img class="right" src="media/photos/yoga.jpg" alt="">

		<p>Did you know that it is your hormones that make the difference in how you store or burn fat? You might be eating a measly 1,200 calories a day and working out with Olympic vigor and STILL not drop weight ~ all due to pesky hormonal imbalances. 
		</p>
		<p>With the Flourish Plan, you will discover how to burn fat most efficiently without feeling deprived or with cravings.  After a brief health history and questionnaire, Liz will guide you through your personal “Flourish” nutrition guide. You will know how often to eat, the right food combinations and the best foods for your hormonal type. 
		</p>
		<p>In the 8 weeks we work together, you will not only lose fat, you will also eliminate your cravings and gain tons of energy. What a relief! 
		</p>
		<p>Your skin will radiate, your abs will start showing and best of all? You will not be spending hours doing cardio or weight training. And THAT is a secret that most magazines and gimmicky diets do NOT want you to know. There is no starving, no skimping, and no excessive exercising required to get your body fat to burn off. 
		</p>

		<h1>LIZ SIGNATURE 6 MONTH PROGRAM
		</h1>

		<p>This program is personally designed for you.  It is not only a nutrition road map but complete holistic health coaching. 
		</p>
		<p>I will guide you in finding out where you may be unbalanced in your primary foods, which is relationships, career, spirituality, physical activity, or social life. I will also find solutions for you to actively lower any stress or anxiety.
		</p>
		<p>I will coach you on the right nutrition plan to balance your hormones and increase your energy.  You will not only feel your best but you will ALSO be a fat burning machine! 
		</p>
		<p>I will come up with your own personal exercise program, specially designed to burn fat in the least amount of time.
		</p>
		<p>I will recommend and support you with a fitness endeavor, be it a 5k run, a competitive swim, obstacle race, or even a half or full marathon. I will help you select what fits your personality and lifestyle. This is super important, because having a goal, other than fat loss, muscle gain, or fitting in your skinny jeans is such a rewarding experience and truly makes you appreciate the miracle of your body!

			<h1>COOKING CLASSES
			</h1>

			<p>Liz loves to share her healthy, super delicious recipes in a non-fussy, fun, and maybe a little messy way!  Food cooked in your kitchen is filled with love and it can truly make a difference in your personal health and the health of your family. It is SO worth taking the time to learn incredibly easy and fun ways to prepare our usual foods. 
			</p>
			<p>Studies have shown that the decline in home cooking is one major reason for the rise in obesity and chronic disease linked to our diet.  Home cooking lets YOU be in control of what is in your meals, and in that respect, it can improve your health so you can have a more nourishing life, eating good foods, and spending time back at the dinner table with the ones you love, flourishing! 
			</p>

			<p>Liz offers in-home cooking classes (great for your family, teens, sisters, cousins, and girlfriends!!) and classes at local kitchen/retail stores. These appointments and classes sell out quickly, so be sure to RSVP for the classes that you see on the event calendar ~ we cannot wait to meet you and make your mealtimes wonderful! 
			</p>

			<h2>Ladies Lunch and Learns
			</h2>

			<p>Anything from sugar cravings, menopause, the best workouts, the best protein supplements, stress, sleep, carbs vs no carbs, best self-tanner and frizz-tamer...nothing is off limits in our conversations. This is a two-hour, casual, fun, and very informative lunch ~ oh, and delicious, too!
			</p>
			<p>I love sharing and learning from other women and with added info and support we ALL flourish!
			</p>
			<p>Please check the Events calendar and email me to get registered for a Lunch and Learn. Bring your neighbor, sister, aunt, mother, cousin, or best friend. Chances are you will know some of the ladies and you'll make new friends & learn great things.

			<h3>SUPPLEMENTS: Why I choose Isagenix</h3>

			<p>Eating real whole foods is superior to any supplement but it is also very hard to get all your nutrients and meals in during the day with food.  
			</p>
			<p>Getting quality vitamins in your diet is very important for mood, energy, and overall quality of life.  
			</p>
			<p>I have looked far and wide for a product line that is not filled with chemicals or harmful or unnecessary ingredients. 
			</p>
			<p>Isagenix is the only protein meal replacement that I found that provides as much as it does: superior taste, no artificial flavors/colors, whey from grass fed cows, no soy or gluten, perfect 1:1 carb to protein ratio, and is produced by a company that stands by its product 100%. Isagenix also offers me a way to work with incredible people who share my values for world class health, and it gives everyone the opportunity to benefit from the amazing company.

			<h1>Products I personally use and recommend <small>(though I will be glad to consult with you and give you individual recommendations)</small></h1>
						<img src="media/photos/strech.jpg" alt="" class="right">
			<ul>
				<li><b>Meal Replacement Shakes:</b> I use Isalean and IsaPro every morning after my workout. This is the best whey protein available and contributes to fat loss, muscle building, and super energy. 
				</li>
				<li><b>Plant Based Protein Shakes:</b> I use this occasionally, as they have a nice berry flavor. A whopping 22 grams of vegan protein, it is ideal for vegetarians or for folks who are whey-sensitive. 
				</li>
				<li><b>Ionix Supreme:</b> I use this product – a fruity flavored natural supplement containing body-boosting adaptogens - when I am feeling a little stressed or training for a race or if I had a high intensity workout. 
				</li>
				<li><b>Ageless Essentials with Product B:</b> Quality vitamins packs, with Omega 3, Vitamin D, CoQ10, Multi Vitamin, CLA. <b>Additional bonus:</b> Telomere support (cutting edge anti-aging!) 
				</li>
				<li><b>E Shots:</b> Energy!! No artificial junk or chemicals added to this energy shot. Natural caffeine and adaptogens give me a boost when training or when I just need a pick me up.
				</li>
				<li><b>Isa Delights:</b> These little yummy chocolates are GOOD for you! Yep, they have green tea and actually speed up your metabolism and curb your cravings. Simply divine! A chocolate a day keeps cravings at bay. ;-) 
				</li>
				<li><b>IsaLeans Bars:</b> I personally do not eat a lot of protein bars but my kids love these. They have 18 grams of protein, are low glycemic and are made with whey (not soy) protein. Delicious, multiple flavors, easy and portable solutions to eating on the go or snacking smart. </li></ul>
