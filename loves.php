<h2>GIRLS ON THE RUN:</h2>

<p>Girls on the run is a non profit organization dedicated to creating a world where girls know and activate her limitless potential and is free to boldly pursue her dreams. Girls that are involved with sports gain life skills, teamwork, have positive body images and high confidence of themselves. But as I experience as a young girl,  sports can be intimidating,  especially now how competitive and costly they have become.  My dream is start a local Girls on the Run in my community so every girl can have the opportunity to be a athlete and benefit from all gifts that come with fitness.  With any of my programs,  25% will be used for the development of a local Girls on the Run.</p>  <a href="http://www.girlsontherun.org/">Website</a></article>

<p>My favorite local market where I can always find quality, grass fed meats and the freshest organic fruits and vegetables.  They have excellent selection of dry pasta, breads, gluten free options and gourmet foods. There homemade soup, deli salads and green juices are so delicious. But what I love most about Pilgrims is their #1 customer service and commitment for the health of their community.</p>

<p>Peacewithin is a happy apparel company that I just love.  Rebecca, the owner,  is highly inspirational and her message of facing your fears, being comfortable in your own skin and living fully is something I strive for. Her apparel is made of super comfy cotton and designs are hip but classic.  Based is Coeur d Alene, peacewithin has a huge following and can ship anywhere.</p>

<article class="repeatable"><h2>BALANCE STUDIO / Yoga Kim</h2>

<p>If you know me, yoga was not something that came natural. I love to run and lift weights. I thought yoga was for some flexibility and Zen time. Well that was before I found Yoga Kim at Balance Studio in Coeur d Alene. Yoga Kim classes are challenging but she always supports you where you are at.  I have tried things I have never would of before like a supported head stand. If you conquer your physical fears why not welcome your other fears that hold you back from being who you truly can be! </p>

<p>An investment in your health for sure. The Vitamix is a staple in our kitchen, great for mixing up protein shakes that turn out like milk shakes and green smoothies that are not only palatable but easy to clean up. The Vitamix is also great for making soups, dips and hummus. Love it!</p>
