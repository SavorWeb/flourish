		<p>I look forward to my weekly appointments with Liz.  My family can't believe that I go to sleep often now before midnight.  I'm a retired night owl and I own this life change to Liz and her guidance.  Once I made the decision to lead a more healthy active life, the pieces came together with the help of Liz and knowledge.   I'm the type of person that needs to be held accountable and knowing that Liz is always going to show up with questions about my diet and exercise since our last appointment, I get my homework done.  The most exciting part that it is easier than I thought.  My mind and body feel better and so does that dark circles under my eyes!  Sleep is a really good thing.  Thank you Liz!!</p>

		<p>Liz Barrett has offered me guidance and support by incorporating better health and wellness into my life. Whether I just needed a bit of advice or a complete overhaul, she was there in an active and supportive role. Liz has helped me to become successful in my health and fitness goals, especially where I had struggled in the past. With her assistance, I was able to recognize obstacles that were standing in the way of my goals, both personally and professionally. <br> <br>
As a result of her continued support, I have been able to establish and maintain a working program to continue down the path of overall health and wellness.
I can't thank her enough!</p>

	<p>Working with you I have gained  so much for confidence with trying new things.   Keeping up with my workouts and being more aware and knowledgable about food was the change I got from your six month program. I have so much more energy and strength.  I loved your individual attention!</p>

	<p>Thank you for your wonderful presentation yesterday. It was such a gift and you are a treasure.  Everyone enjoyed it a lot and we all learned a ton.  I know we got a bit too chatty and off topic BUT still, I think you were so helpful.  I am so inspired by your healthy lifestyle, positive attitude and your wonderful spirit.</p>
